3. A DESCRIPTION OF ANY KNOWN COMPILE OR RUNTIME ERRORS, CODE LIMITATIONS, OR DEVATIONS FROM ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS (IF APPLICABLE)
- For the calculation of mean and longest Window idle time, this program counts the idle time the windows have after the queue is cleared but the windows are
not all cleared, as the Spec doesn't explicitly required a specific way, nor the Slack chat explicitly discussed about. 
- For the counting of quantity of students/ windows having waiting time/ idle time greater than the specified amount, this program doesn't count the equaled 
amounts, as the Spec specificly asked for the "Greater than" not "Greater than or equal to".
